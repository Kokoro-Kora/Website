<blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu">
The <del>Toasted bread</del> Shiba inus (<b>柴犬</b>) is a dogbreed from Japan. A small-to-medium breed,
it is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native
to Japan. A small, alert and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous
terrain and hiking trails, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting.
It looks similar to and is often mistaken for other Japanese dog breeds such as
the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a
distinct blood line, temperament, and smaller size than other Japanese
dog breeds. </blockquote>
